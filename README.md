# Ai-travel-planner-for-students
Planning trips is often time-consuming and expensive, especially for students with  limited budgets. Current travel apps provide generic suggestions. A system that  integrates maps, location data, and generative AI to create personalized, budget- friendly itineraries would help students plan efficient and enjoyable trips.

#  PROBLEM STATEMENT

Design and build an AI-driven Travel Planner Student that:

-Recommends destinations and generates customized itineraries.
-Suggests transportation and lodging options.
-Integrates real-time data such as weather, maps, and local events.
-Handles bookings and provides timely alerts.
-Dynamically adjusts schedules for optimal planning.

#  SYSTEM APPROACH

Frontend
Streamlit app for user interaction (chat UI, input/output display)

Backend
Python logic to handle chat flow, model inference, and session state

Model Engine
LLaMA-based model (e.g., via HuggingFace Transformers or llama.cpp)

Data Handling
Optional logging, feedback collection, or prompt templates
